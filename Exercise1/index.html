              The series premiered on AMC on February 8, 2015. The tenth season
              consists of 13 episodes and aired on Sundays at 9:00 pm (Eastern)
              in the United States. A spin-off prequel of Breaking Bad, Better
              Call Saul was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, both of
              whom also worked on Breaking Bad.
            </p>
            <p>
              Set primarily in the early 2000s in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
              several years before Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul examines the
              moral declines of Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), an earnest lawyer
              and former con artist who becomes the egocentric criminal-defense
              attorney Saul Goodman, and Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a
              former corrupt police officer who becomes a fixer and enforcer for
              drug traffickers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other main characters include Jimmy's romantic interest and
              colleague Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn), his brother and rival Chuck
              McGill (Michael McKean), Chuck's law partner Howard Hamlin
              (Patrick Fabian), the drug dealer Nacho Varga (Michael Mando), the
              drug lord Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), and the cartel enforcer
              Lalo Salamanca (Tony Dalton). In addition to the primary
              storyline, Better Call Saul includes black-and-white flashforwards
              set in 2010, after the events of Breaking Bad, which explore the
              consequences of Saul's eventual partnership with the drug lord
              Walter White (Bryan Cranston).

                <p class="cast-intro">Saul is a self-centered and unscrupulous Albuquerque-based lawyer who embraces his tactics as a former scam artist and becomes involved in the city's criminal underworld. In Breaking Bad, he acts as the consigliere for the methamphetamine cooks Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) and plays a crucial role in the development of their drug empire. Better Call Saul's main prequel storyline depicts Saul's origins as the earnest lawyer Jimmy McGill and his moral deterioration in the six years before the events of Breaking Bad; it also features a sequel storyline, where Saul is living under the assumed name Gene Takavic, that explores the consequences of his actions in Breaking Bad.</p>

                    Mike as a character has been praised by critics and Banks' performance has received several acting awards and nominations.
